Hello this is a simple spreadsheet program that can store 3 types of cells. 
Text cells which contain text, formula cells which contain a mathematical 
expression and percent cells which store a percent. 
The rows are labeled A-J and the columns 1-10.
To set a cell to a value start with the row letter then column followed by a 
space then equals sign like 'G6 ='.
A text cell is set by enclosing a phrase in double quotes after the equals.
A4 = "Hello World"
The space after the equals is important. 
A forumla cell is set by enclosing a math expression with parentheses
B10 = (2/(3*5) + 7)
A percent cell is created by entering a decimal number followed by a percent sign
C8 = 23.94%
To print the value of a single cell input the location of the cell on the grid. 
e.g. B10
To print the entire grid input "print grid"
To copy a spreadsheet into a text file input "copy grid example.txt"
